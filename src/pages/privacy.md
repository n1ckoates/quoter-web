# Quoter Privacy Policy

**Last updated on June 4th, 2023.**

This document explains what data is collected, how it's used, and how you can delete your data. **If you have any questions/concerns about this Privacy Policy, join our [support server](https://discord.gg/QzXTgS2CNk) OR email [nick@nickoates.com](mailto:nick@nickoates.com)**.

## Data collected

-   Information you directly provide to Quoter, like the contents of a quote when using `/newquote`.
-   Basic information and metadata about quote creation, such as the time & date, the Discord user ID of the person who created the quote, and the message ID & channel ID of the original message.

## Data usage

Quoter only uses data to provide it's own functionality: displaying quotes. We never use or collect data for marketing and/or analytics, and we don't sell it either.

## Data deletion

If Quoter is online when it's removed from a Discord server, all of that server's data will be immediately deleted. Otherwise, Quoter will scan for removed servers the next time it's online, and delete data as so.

Quoter takes daily backups of all data, which may include later deleted data. These backups are stored for 30 days, after which they are deleted.

You can also contact us (refer to the beginning of this document) to manually remove your data.
